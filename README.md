# Working Through

- Title: Machine Learning in Production
- Author: Suhas Pote
- ISBN: 978-93-55518-101

## Prerequisites

This work-through uses Python 3.12.3 via `uv` on Ubuntu 24.04.3.
The book was written against Ubuntu 17/18 and Python 3.6.

While the book recommends [Visual Studio Code][vscode], most work
done here will be using [vim][vimget] or [VSCodium][codium], if,
for example, we try any recommended VS Code plugins.
